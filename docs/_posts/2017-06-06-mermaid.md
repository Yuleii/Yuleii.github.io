[Documentation](https://tianqi.name/jekyll-TeXt-theme/docs/en/markdown-enhancements#mermaid)

Generation of diagrams and flowcharts from text in a similar manner as markdown.

Ever wanted to simplify documentation and avoid heavy tools like Visio when explaining your code?

This is why [mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/) was born, a simple markdown-like script language for generating charts from text via javascript.

## Flowchart

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

**markdown:**

    ```mermaid
    graph TD;
        A-->B;
        A-->C;
        B-->D;
        C-->D;
    ```

## Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->John: Hello John, how are you?
    loop Healthcheck
        John->John: Fight against hypochondria
    end
    Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail...
    John-->Alice: Great!
    John->Bob: How about you?
    Bob-->John: Jolly good!
```

**markdown:**

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Alice
        participant Bob
        Alice->John: Hello John, how are you?
        loop Healthcheck
            John->John: Fight against hypochondria
        end
        Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail...
        John-->Alice: Great!
        John->Bob: How about you?
        Bob-->John: Jolly good!
    ```
