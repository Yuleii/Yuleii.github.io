## Introducing Yourself in Business Settings

### Language to Introducing Yourself

Introduce yourself:
- Hello. My name is...
- I'm...
- I am from…
  
Respond:
- Nice to meet you.
- How are you?
- How do you do?

### Tips for keeping a Conversation Going

1. Show your interest in the speaker with these kinds of nonverbal actions:
   - Head nod
   - Eye contact
   - Open posture

2. Show your interest and understanding with rejoinders:
   - Hm.
   - Oh huh.
   - Oh.
   - Really?
   - Great./ Good.
   - That's interesting/surprising/great/too bad/etc.
   - Califonia? Uh huh.
   - How interesting. 

3. Ask questions:
   - Small world. So how do you know her?
   - And how do you like Seattle?
   - Oh. When was the last time?
   - What happened?
   - Do you know…?

4. Use nonverbal signals to show you don't understand.
   - a puzzled expression
   - a head tilt

5. You can also say things to clarify or get the speaker to explain.
   - Sorry?
   - I'm sorry?
   - You said...?
   - You mean...?
   - Could you say that again?

### Examples of Leaving a Conversation

- I guess the speech is about to begin. 
- Hmm, I didn't realize it was so late, I'd better get going. 
- Will you excuse me? I have to meet someone for dinner. 
- Well... 
- Well... (it was) nice to meet you.
- Well... It was nice to see you. 
- Well... nice to see you again.
- You, too. 
- Nice to meet/see you, too. 

### Real Language

1. **So**, with falling information is a way to make a question seem less direct.
   - So...are you from Seattle? 
   - So...do you work here? 
   - So...you're from London? 
  
   We also use **So** to change the topic or move on to the next thing. 
   - So...what should we do next?
   - So...should we get back to work?

2. We also use **well** to show that we're thinking something over, or to express hesitation, and we use it to begin to end a conversation.
   -  Well, thanks for your input.
   -  Well, it was nice to meet you.

3. When you answer a question you can throw the question back to the speaker with **how about you**?
-  I work for SQL Electronics. How about you? 
-  I'm with RDX Systems in Toronto.

## Making Contact 

### Business Cards

- What's the best way to contact you? 
- Is there a good way to reach you?
- Do you have a card? 
- Why don't I give you my card? 
- Here, let me give you my card. 
- May I give you my card? 
- Here's my card.
- Here you are.
- And here's mine.

###  How to Create a Good Network

- So you're based in Seattle? I was a student there.
- So you're a software engineer. My sister's a software engineer, too.
- EcoSoft? I have a good friend who works there.

> - So how's business going? 
> - Great. We're even thinking of expanding into California. 
> - Really? Listen, I know someone who has a lot of experience in retail in San Francisco. She might be able to give you some tips. > That would be very helpful. 
> - Well, do you have a card? 
> Sure. 
> - Then if it's okay, I can pass on your contact details to her. 
> - Definitely. I appreciate it. Here you are. 
> - Thanks. And here's mine.
