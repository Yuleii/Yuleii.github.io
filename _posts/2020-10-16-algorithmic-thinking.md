## Five Steps of Algorithmic Thinking

- Understanding the problem. 
    - What are the input/output?
    - Do a few examples by hand.
    - Think about special cases.
- Formulating the problem. 
    - Think about the data and the best way to represent them (graphs, strings, etc.)
    - What mathematical criterion corresponds to the desired output?
- Developing an algorithm. 
    - Is the formulated problem amenable to a certain algorithm design
technique (greedy, divide-and-conquer, etc.)?
    - What data structures make sense to use? 
    - Is the algorithm correct? 
    - Is the algorithm efficient?
    - If the problem is “too hard,” do we want an approximation algorithm,
a randomized algorithm, a heuristic, ...? 
- Implementing the algorithm. 
    - Most algorithms are destined to be ultimately implemented as computer
programs.
    - The peril lies in the possibility of making the transition from an algorithm to a
program either incorrectly or very inefficiently. 
    - The opportunity lies in the possibility to better understand the
algorithm and even to improve it. 
- running it on the data and answering the original question.
    - Sometimes, it is discovered after this entire process is followed, that
the solution is not satisfactory. This might require going back to step
(1) and repeating the entire process. 

## Pseudo-code

[Pseudo-code syntax](https://storage.googleapis.com/codeskulptor-alg/pdf/PseudoCodeLibrary.pdf)

Pseudo-code is a high-level, abstract description of an algorithm that is intended to be read by humans and subsequently turned into a program in a programming language of choice. As such, pseudo-code provides the details needed to understand the algorithm, but omits many details that are left to the programmer to implement, since those may vary depending on the programming language and the choice of implementation.
