Say that I'm changed, say I'm different   
Maybe I'll finally understand   
Say I'll let go, say it's obvious   
Oh, I tell myself over, over and over again   
I'm ready, I'm ready   
I'm ready to believe   
   
So tell me I'm strong, tell me I'm weak   
Tell me I'll never, ever bend   
Then tell me I'm fire, tell me I'm cold   
Cold oh, I tell myself over, over and over again   
I'm ready, I'm ready   
I'm ready to believe    
   
And all the world can watch the choices you make   
All the world can watch each tiny mistake   
Let the world watch to let the world wait for you   
So tell me I'm wrong, or tell me I'm cruel   
Tell me I'd fight, yeah tell me I fought for the wrong things    
      
But I'm ready, I'm ready   
I'm ready to believe   
I'm ready, I'm ready   
I'm ready to believe
